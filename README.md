Developed a wireless pothole detection system using a YOLOv8 machine learning model to identify and mark potholes. Designed and implemented a stereo vision setup using two ESP32 cameras to estimate the distance to potholes and calculate their area and volume. A GPS module was integrated to log the exact location of each pothole. An additional ESP32 module was used to wirelessly transmit all captured data—including images, depth information, and GPS coordinates—to a laptop, where the YOLOv8 model performed detection and calculated the repair volume and estimated cost. All collected data, including pothole location, dimensions, and repair cost, was displayed on a Flask-based web interface for easy visualization and analysis.
